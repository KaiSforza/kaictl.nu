# Kaictl Nu Modules

Just a few modules that I want to have available for improvements to Nushell and
other commands.

Also includes a bunch of environment stuff that could be put into an autoload,
but is separate and can be used with `overlay use ./kaictl.nu/env`.

## `base`

Contains the commands and other things that users will probably want, without
modifying the environment.
